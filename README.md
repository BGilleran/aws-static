# Deploy Static Website on AWS

In this project, I deployed a static website to AWS using S3, CloudFront, and IAM.

The site can be accessed using the following <a href="http://darv00xn2o6q3.cloudfront.net/index.html">link</a>.

The files included are: 

index.html - The Index document for the website.

/img - The background image file for the website.

/css - CSS files for the website.

/s3 images - Folder contains step by step images of project requirements.


Note: The following folder containing 3rd party libraries has been omitted from repo upload. 
/vendor - Bootssrap CSS framework, Font, and JavaScript libraries needed for the website to function.
